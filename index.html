        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numerous and implemented by many organizations including government agencies and
not-for-profit organizations. However, with this great ability, concerns exist regarding
social, ethical, and legal issues associated with data mining. Unfortunately, these issues
are not fully defined, and the future of data mining is uncertain with the threat of
regulation looming.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data has been gathered and recorded for thousands of years and used to manage
day-to-day operations. For a long time, financial and insurance companies have mined
their data to detect patterns of fraudulent credit card usage, find hidden correlations
between financial indicators, identify behavior patterns of risky customers, and analyze
claims. Utility companies have used it for decades to predict when a generator might fail.
Data mining is not new, but widespread interest in it is a recent phenomenon.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, data sets were small in size, typically containing fewer than ten
variables (Fayyad, 2001). Data analysis traditionally revolved around graphs, charts, and
tables. But the real-time collection of data, based on thousands of variables, is practically
impossible for anyone to analyze today without the aid of information systems. With
such aid however, the amount of information you can “mine” is astonishing. Organizations have only recently begun to examine how their vast collections of data can be mined
strategically. Data mining extracts value from volume.</p>
        <p Sstyle="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous definitions of data mining exist. One definition is that it is the “mechanized process of identifying and discovering useful structures in data” (Fayyad, 2001,
p. 62). In this context, “structure” refers to patterns, models, and relationships in the data.
Data-mining techniques draw upon such diverse areas as probability theory, information
theory, estimation, uncertainty, graph theory, and database techniques (Fayyad, 2001).
In addition, artificial intelligence techniques such as neural networks, expert systems,
and classification algorithms are used. Another definition states that data mining
involves extracting hidden predictive information from databases to solve business
problems (Brandel, 2001). Often the term is misused to describe new ways to present data.
Data mining does more than just present existing data in new ways—it facilitates the
discovery of previously unknown relationships among the data. To further illustrate the
point, consider most standard database operations. These operations present results
that users already intuitively knew existed in the database. Data mining extracts
information from the database the user did not anticipate. Data mining creates information that can be leveraged by the organization to create a competitive advantage.
However, it is just as likely to identify meaningless patterns or trends, wasting time and
resources.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter highlights both the positive and negative aspects of data mining.
Specifically, the social, ethical, and legal implications of data mining are examined
through recent case law, current public opinion, and small industry-specific examples.
There are many issues concerning this topic. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is
to expose the reader to some of the more interesting ones and provide insight into how
information systems (IS) professionals and businesses may protect themselves from the
negative ramifications associated with improper use of data. The more experience with
and exposure to social, ethical, and legal concerns with respect to data mining, the better
prepared you will be to prevent trouble down the road. Before examining these issues,
it is helpful to understand how data is gathered and what can be inferred from it.</p>
        <h1>WHAT CAN BE INFERRED FROM DATA?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear often accompanies progress. Historically, the threat of invading one’s
personal privacy was more of a potential than a reality. However, with the increased use
of electronic communications and the World Wide Web (WWW), it has become quite
easy and inexpensive to share information among trading partners. Prior to the mid1990s, there were technical barriers as well as economic disincentives to the sharing of
information. As these barriers have fallen, the potential for data-mining use and abuse
has increased.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, society was very concerned about “Big Brother” (the government)
gathering data and determining what individuals were doing in their personal lives.
Interestingly, as a new century begins, it appears as if the organizations most likely to
invade your privacy are local businesses. When one considers the quantity of data
collected about consumers, it is mind-boggling. Just consider the level of detail
contained in the purchasing history of individuals who use VIP, shopper club cards, or
credit cards to obtain store discounts. Through these membership cards, companies are
able to track your purchases, possibly deducing your interests. In addition, data may
be gathered about you in the most unlikely of places. For example, imagine working out
at your local gym on a computerized stair stepper or stationary bike. A computer tracks
your heartbeat or the number of steps taken per minute. Netpulse Communications
Incorporated (www.netpulse.com) does just that. It links its exercise equipment to a
national database of healthcare member profiles. “By surveying members, Netpulse
plans to flesh out the profiles to include the person’s age, weight, gender, birth date,
address, and product-buying preferences” (Markoff, 1999, p. 96). Netpulse’s intention
is to provide online advertising based on individual profiles.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data, information, and knowledge vary in their stability. For example, knowing a
customer bought Scooby Doo fruit snacks is less important than the fact the customer
has children. “The fact that a customer has diabetes is more stable than a particular
pattern of food purchases that may allow inferring he or she has diabetes” (McCarthy,
2000, p. 75). More stable facts such as a person has children or diabetes are more
predictive of future behaviors than simple observational facts such as diapers were
purchased on the 12th of last month.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, no matter how you categorize data, the quantity of data collected
about an individual is substantial —demographic information, customer satisfaction,
legal history, insurance records, purchase preferences, financial and banking information, as well as medical profiles. One thing that IS and business professionals must realize
is that following ethical practices and respecting the privacy of individuals makes good
business sense. Bad publicity associated with a single incident can taint a company’s
reputation for years, even when that company has followed the law and done everything
that it perceives possible to ensure the privacy of those from whom the data was gathered.
An example of a company that knows all too well the politics of the privacy debate is N2H2.
Its Internet filtering software is used by 40% of U.S. schools. N2H2 decided last year to
sell its aggregated data. It followed the rules set forth by the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act, and the data did not contain names or personal information (Wilder &
Soat, 2001). However, it had so many people up in arms over the selling of this data that
it scrapped the project. Thus, even though N2H2 was well within its legal rights to sell its aggregate data, the public viewed this as unethical. In the next section, we discuss
ethics and their relevance to data mining.</p>
        <h1>ETHICAL ISSUES</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot separate technology and its uses and still be ethically and socially
responsible. As a professional, you must explore how the technology you create will be
used. Ethics are standards of conduct that are agreed upon by cultures and organizations. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart defines ethics as knowing the difference
between what you have a right to do and what is right to do. It is important that IS
professionals act according to the highest ethical standards or else face increased
governmental intervention.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, when professionals in the data industry are asked what they think of their
ethical obligation concerning databases and data mining, their response is that they are
obligated to follow the letter of the law. Of course, they must adhere to the law. But ethics
are oftentimes more restrictive than what is called for by the law. Sadly, there are a number
of IS professionals who either lack an awareness of what their companies actually do with
data, or purposely come to the conclusion that it is not their business. They are enablers
in the sense that they solve management’s problems. What management does with that
data is not their concern.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there guidelines or an ethical code to help database experts as they grapple with
ethical dilemmas? Should there be such guidelines? Many people in the IS arena say
no. They argue it is not their place to decide how data is used, but rather up to others
in the organization to make that determination. But what is the ethical obligation of an
IS professional who, through whatever means, finds out that the data that he or she has
been asked to gather or “mine” is going to be used in a manner that they believe is
unethical. The answer to that question, of course, has to be addressed individually,
based on one’s own ethical standards. But as data mining becomes more commonplace
and as companies push for even greater profits and marketshare, IS professionals will
increasingly encounter ethical dilemmas</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 31 of The Direct Marketing Association’s Guidelines for Ethical Business
Practice states that “Marketers should be sensitive to the issue of consumer privacy and
should only collect, combine, rent, sell, exchange, or use marketing data. Marketing data
should be used only for marketing purposes” (DMA Ethical Guidelines, 2002). Essentially, what is of the utmost importance to consumers is that information collected for one
purpose should not be analyzed for an unrelated secondary purpose unless it is clearly
compatible with the original purpose. Michael Turner, executive director of the Information Services Executive Council, a New York-based affiliate of the Direct Marketing
Association, states, “For instance, detailed consumer information lets apparel retailers
market their products to consumers with more precision. But if privacy rules impose
restrictions and barriers to data collection, those limitations could increase the prices
consumers pay when they buy from catalog or online apparel retailers by 3.5% to 11%”
(Thibodeau, 2001, p. 36). Obviously, if retailers cannot target their advertising, then their
only option is to mass advertise, which drives up costs.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological advances make it possible to track in great detail what a person does
in his or her personal life. With this profile of personal details comes a substantial ethical
obligation to safeguard this data from disclosure to unauthorized individuals. Ignoring
any legal ramifications, the ethical responsibility is firmly placed on IS professionals and
businesses whether they like it or not. Otherwise, they risk lawsuits and harm individuals
in the process.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data industry has come under harsh review. There is a raft of federal and
local laws under consideration to control the collection, sale, and use of data.
American companies have yet to match the tougher privacy regulations
already in place in Europe, while personal and class-action litigation against
businesses over data privacy issues is increasing. (Wilder & Soat, 2001, p. 38)</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1 demonstrates the iterative nature of how business practices create ethical
dilemmas that harm individuals who assert pressure on society to create laws and
regulations that change business practices. In following the outer loop of the diagram
starting at the top-left, what often happens is that organizations, through some unethical
activity, ultimately harm one or more individuals. In addition to gathering data about
purchases, businesses oftentimes share information with others who are required to
process the order. For example, payment credit card clearinghouses and package delivery
companies must be informed of the order, where to pick it up, who to deliver it to, and
sometimes the contents of the shipment as well. These third party providers also must
adhere to the highest ethical standards, but sometimes, based on this shared data, these
third parties attempt to sell goods and services directly to individuals (consumers) or sell
the data to others. Following the top-right-hand side of Figure 1, individuals who are
negatively impacted by this experience create an awareness of the problem in society and
help build pressure within society for lawmakers to address the issue. As illustrated by
the bottom part of Figure 1, society creates pressure on the government and lawmakers
to create laws and regulations; if enough pressure is placed upon the government and
lawmakers, laws and regulations are created (illustrated at the left-hand side). These laws
and regulations, in turn, place restrictions and penalties on organizations, and the cycle
continues. Like all cycles, sometimes laws and regulations go too far in one direction or
another, whether we are talking about being too restrictive for businesses or too lax in
terms of protecting consumers. The situation where businesses are placed under too
many restrictions ultimately harms consumers through, for example, inflated marketing
costs.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner square deals with social and ethical implications that are presented.
Organizations are concerned with the question of “How do we gather data?” without
posing problems for individuals with respect to their right to privacy. Individuals are
concerned with the question of “How do we protect our privacy?” while still maintaining
national security and consuming customized goods and services? Sadly, many consumers have become accustomed or, more accurately, resigned to the fact that businesses
gather personal information about them, often surreptitiously. With enough individuals
concerned about privacy, society is concerned with the question of “How do we ensure
data is used in a socially responsible manner?”</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawmakers and the government must then be charged with the task of answering
the question of “How do we enforce these laws and regulations?” Oftentimes, laws and</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Image Description">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regulations are created by society – not to protect the individual, but rather to protect
society itself. Consider what would happen if such laws and regulations did not exist.
In that case, consumers might stop giving information (at least accurate information) if
they were concerned about privacy. Then, information about purchasing behavior and
all other aspects of society would become limited and unavailable to those who need to
make decisions. So, although laws and regulations are often in response to abuses
perpetrated by organizations on individuals, in reality, society is acting in its own selfinterest. Those who make laws and regulations understand the importance, in this case,
of information in our economy. Even privacy advocates concede there are benefits to
society when personal data is shared. Privacy advocates do not argue that consumer
information should not be shared, but rather that consumers themselves should be given
the option of how much information is shared and with whom.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses are correct when they complain that much of the regulatory initiatives
are driven by unusual cases of misuse of information. However, society is predisposed
to believe the worst. These stories of misuse only confirm its pre-existing fears.
Therefore, businesses must be sensitive to how the public perceives their business
practices, which include data mining. In an attempt to elevate data privacy to the level</p>
